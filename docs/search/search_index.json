Our core research focus is on mechanisms of mRNA translation, but we also study immunity and cancer through collaborations. Roles & Expectations \u00b6 Everyone \u00b6 is motivated to learn new ideas and techniques. Projects in our lab are rarely repetitive. You should be willing to get outside your comfort zone on a regular basis and embrace a steep learning curve. It is normal to struggle and be frustrated when you are learning something new, so you should not feel discouraged.

Irrespective of your career stage and career goals, we aim to train independently thinking scientific leaders, and not merely skilled research technicians. In practice, this means you should spend your first year in the lab learning skills and concepts from others. After that, your focus should shift towards learning to solve problems on your own.

All new projects in the lab build off the discoveries and expertise of previous lab members. When you join our lab, you will work closely and learn from others in the lab. When you have spent a few years in the lab, you will help others get started with new techniques even if you do not directly benefit from them. is respectful. All of us share a common passion for scientific research, but we often come from different cultural backgrounds, have distinct strengths and weaknesses, personalities, and working styles. Be respectful of your fellow labmates even if you do not see eye-to-eye with them on some professional or personal matter. PhD and Postdoc Trainees \u00b6 Keep track of all academic requirements in a timely manner (for PhD students). This includes setting up thesis committee meetings, finishing course work, and teaching requirements. Work closely with Rasi to craft and revise research proposals and presentations. Be prompt and diligent in your lab duties. Apply for all available sources of stipend and fellowships. Long-term Research Staff \u00b6 Help move others' projects forward by contributing unique skills. Establish new techniques in the lab and take on risky projects. Manage day-to-day operations such as equipment maintenance and lab duties. Ensure that the lab space is well organized with all equipment and supplies in their assigned location. PI \u00b6 Provide feedback on research design, execution, and results. Provide feedback on manuscripts, presentations, and fellowship applications. Help lab members meet their training and career development goals. Ensure a vibrant and safe lab atmosphere conducive to learning and research for all lab members. Acquire funding through writing grants. Highlight lab's research and trainees through conferences and outside seminars. Set long-term vision and trajectory for the lab. Manage the portfolio of projects in the lab to balance productivity and impact. Logistics \u00b6 Communication \u00b6 We use Slack for informal non-scientific communication. We use GitHub Issues for recording and organizing all our scientific communication. All GitHub repositories are set up to automatically ping to Slack upon updates. For more information on how to use GitHub Issues, see How to use GitHub issues and branches .. Lab Notebooks \u00b6 We use GitHub Repositories to record all our scientific work. GitHub repositories are essentially cloud-synced folders which enable collaborative work, version control, discussion, and project management, all in one place. In our lab, GitHub repositories are divided by projects, and not by individual lab members. Record your day-to-day scientific work as well as fellowship and manuscript drafts in the appropriate project repository. For more information on how to record your work on GitHub repositories, see TBD . Weekly Updates \u00b6 We use GitHub Project Boards for tracking progress on individual Issues. Before the end of every work week, lab members update their project board to indicate what Issues they worked on the past week and plan to do so in the next week. Then post a new detailed comment in each Issue with the title Update indicating what you did or plan to do along with links to notebooks, figures, code as appropriate. Lab Meetings \u00b6 We have weekly lab meetings on Wednesdays at 3:30pm, and they typically last for 1-1.5 hours. We cycle between short updates by everyone, longer updates by one lab member, journal club, and a no-meeting week every month. See current lab meeting calendar here .s Work Hours and Vacation \u00b6 Everyone will typically be in the lab between 10am and 5p on weekdays. Outside this window, each lab member sets their own schedule based on their research activity and personal constraints. If you are taking time off during regular hours, put it on the lab calendar. If you are planning to take more than a few days off, plan in advance so that your research is at a good stopping point. Additionally, let Rasi know and add it to the lab calendar as early as possible. Contact Info \u00b6 If you need to urgently contact lab members when they are not in the lab, see here . External Logins \u00b6 We create a single common login for ordering using all external vendors. See this page for login information. We have standing POs for a few vendors that we use frequently. Make sure to use the most recent standing PO numbers. Grant Numbers \u00b6 See here for information on grant numbers to use for ordering and shared resources use. Technical How-Tos \u00b6 We have detailed how-to pages with sub sections for experiments , data analysis , software , and writing . Onboarding \u00b6 Join Github and share username with Rasi. Join Slack and share username with Rasi. Get access to our lab Github repository for your project. Ask Rasi to give your email access to the lab Google calendar. Get access to lab database for ordering, plasmids, cell lines, oligos. Get access to rhino computing cluster by contacting scicomp@fredhutch.org. We use this for all computational work. Get access to lab AWS S3 storage by contacting helpdesk@fredhutch.org. We use this for storing all experimental data. Learn lab organizational structure for experiments and data analyses . Learn git . Learn VSCode and Markdown for writing and version control. Learn to use Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode and the tidyverse R package for routine data analysis tasks. Open a GitHub Issue to discuss an idea, collate literature, plan your first experiment, or start a data analysis task. Add yourself to our lab website (not necessary for rotation students). Offboarding \u00b6 Data and Analysis Create a summary post of key to-do items for your projects in the respective GitHub repository at notes/USER/offboarding_summary.md . In the summary post, include all boxes that you are leaving for future use. Move plasmid maps you entered into our plasmid / cell line database into the lab_database folder in Snapgene . All your raw data should be in AWS S3 under fh-pi-subramaniam-a-eco/data/USER/ . Commit all your presentations to rasilab/PROJECT/presentations/USER . Put all your fellowship applications reports in rasilab/PROJECT/grants/USER repo. Commit any code that you wrote from /fh/scratch/delete90/subramaniam_a/user/git/PROJECT to http://github.com/rasilab/PROJECT . Lab Bench Give enzyme or expensive reagent aliquots to suitable lab member. If in doubt, ask Rasi. Put all lab ware (unopened pipettes, tube racks, cardboard boxes) in their common places or give to another lab member. Throw away all tubes and intermediate samples in the freezer and on your bench. Throw away any agar plates with bacteria / yeast or tissue culture plates. Get rid of inexpensive buffer aliquots. Clean out your drawers. Put pipettors in drawer 73.

We want to use it when we have a pipeline of successive data analysis tasks. If we change one of those tasks slightly, we do not want to run the entire analysis again but only the parts that changed. Snakemake allows automatic tracking of files that changes and rerunning only those parts of the pipeline that depend on the change. See the Snakemake tutorial for a detailed introduction. Here I am noting down only those features that I find relevant as I am learning to use Snakemake myself. Snakemake files are Python scripts with extra features. Use {sample} as wildcard in both input and output fields of a rule . Use snakemake -np to do a dry run that shows that what rules will be executed along with the scripts involved. Use snakemake RULENAME to run the rule RULENAME instead of the first rule in the file (the latter is the default). Use {wildcard.sample} in the shell field to access the wildcard sample 's value. Expand wildcards within the script as: expand ( \"processed_data/ {sample} . {replicate} .bam\" , sample = [ \"A\" , \"B\" ], replicate = [ 0 , 1 ]) In the shell field, we can refer to subfields in the input and output field by a dot prefix: shell : \"samtools mpileup -g -f {input.fa} {input.bam} | \" Note that Snakemake fields are available to target Python , R , Rmarkdown scripts in the script field as snakemake objects. See here . protected() protects a file from being accidentally deleted or modified once it is created. temp() deletes a file after all rules that require it have been completed. directory() to use a directory as output if the number or names of output files are unknown. ancient() makes the corresponding input file always older than the output file so that the rule is not run.","title":"Introduction to snakemake"},{"location":"bioinformatics/useful_biology_databases/","text":"Database of several useful databases for disease and molecular biology: https://www.science.co.il/biomedical/databases/Mutation-databases.php HGMD The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD\u00ae) represents an attempt to collate all known (published) gene lesions responsible for human inherited disease.

Do this even for experiments where the data is already on the Fred Hutch cluster, such as deep sequencing data. Use the link and login info here to access the AWS S3 bucket. Data for any single experiment should go into the folder fh-pi-subramaniam-a-eco/data/USER-NAME/EXPT-TYPE/YYYYMMDD_EXPT-NAME_EXPT-DESCRIPTION/ . Every experiment folder much have an associated sample_annotations.csv file in the same folder. See here for how to create this file. You should create sample_annotations.csv even for assays that yield a single image such as Western blots. The only exceptions are agarose gel images, Sanger sequencing data, and Nanodrop measurements (only those measurements that are unlikely to be used in a publication or analyzed quantitatively). You can login to AWS S3 from any computer connected to the internet and upload your data files using the web interface. Alternately, you can also use the AWS CLI command cp to copy from your local computer to the AWS S3 bucket after you create the bucket. See example below. Analyses \u00b6 All analysis should be performed in the project GitHub repository cloned to /fh/scratch/delete90/subramaniam_a/USER-NAME/git/REPO-NAME . Create a new branch for each analysis and merge it with main or master when the analysis is complete. Analysis scripts for any single experiment should go into the folder analysis/USER-NAME/EXPT-TYPE/YYYYMMDD_EXPT-NAME_EXPT-DESCRIPTION/ . Each analysis folder should contain a README.md file at the top level. All other files should be stored in one of data , annotations , scripts , figures , tables subfolders. Raw data and sample annotations should be copied from AWS S3 into analysis/USER-NAME/EXPT-TYPE/YYYYMMDD_EXPT-NAME_EXPT-DESCRIPTION/data/ . For multistep analysis such deep sequencing where you generate lot of processed data, store your raw data in a subfolder of data such as fastq . Copy files from AWS S3 to the data folder using the following aws cli command. Store this command as aws_s3_cp.sh in the data folder and commit it to GitHub so that you can easily run it again the next time you want to perform the analysis. aws cp s3://fh-pi-subramaniam-a-eco/data/USER-NAME/EXPT-TYPE/YYYYMMDD_EXPT-NAME_EXPT-DESCRIPTION/ . Commit README.md, scripts and small image and tables (<1MB) to GitHub. All tables should be in CSV or TSV format and not in XLS or ODS format. All figures should be PDF format so that they can be edited in Inkscape. The only exceptions are scatter plots with lot of points where a PNG is suitable to save space. The analysis should be fully reproducible by running a single script such as Jupyter Notebook or a Snakemake pipeline. Note that all intermediate files will be automatically deleted after 90 days in the scratch folder. Software \u00b6 All analysis should be performed in singularity containers or conda environments that can be reproducibly created from a Dockerfile or an environment.yml file, respectively. We perform simple analyses on the cluster from within VSCode using the Remote SSH extension. For more comple analyses that need to run over multiple days, we run commands from tmux session on the cluster to preserve the session if the connection is lost. Simple analyses \u00b6 For quick analysis on the cluster with a single script (such as for a flow experiment), use one of the pre-created conda environments that mirrors our lab's project_repo folder. You can list all available environments in the cluster using the following command. You should be also able to see the corresponding Jupyter kernel in VSCode. ```bash conda info --envs ``` If you want to create such an environment from a Dockerfile , convert the mamba create and mamba install commands for that environment into a shell script and run it. Multi-step analyses \u00b6 Either use one of our lab's predefined singularity containers pulled from our lab's package repository or create your own singularity container from a Dockerfile file. To pull a singularity container from our lab's package repository, use the following command.

You should create sample_annotations.csv even for assays that yield a single image such as Western blots. The only exceptions are agarose gel images, Sanger sequencing data, and Nanodrop measurements (only those measurements that are unlikely to be used in a publication or analyzed quantitatively).

For example, In a plate reader or qPCR experiment, you will want a plate number column and a well number column for each measured well. In a flow cytometry experiment, create a column with the unique specimen number or the unique filename for each sample. In a deep sequencing experiment, it will be the unique index for each library. In a Western blot, it will be a gel number column and a lane number column. Step 2 \u00b6 Create one meta data column for each biological and technical variable that you are changing in your experiment. For example: you did your experiment with three different gene knockouts each knockout had two different fluorescent reporters each fluorescent reporter is induced at 3 different concentrations there are 3 technical replicates for each strain. So the metadata columns you will create are: knockoutgene reporter inductionlevel replicate In addition, create a column called samplelabel with a succinct unique name for each sample (see the example below). Step 3 \u00b6 Save the file as sampleannotations.csv by choosing CSV file type and , as field separator. Important Pointers \u00b6 Remember that each variable gets a column. For example, if you collected the same sample at different time points, then create a timepoint metadata column. You can insert NA in columns for which the metadata is not applicable \u2013 for example, use NA for an empty well in a plate reader experiment.

Procedure Results Goal \u00b6 Viewing data on the microscope computer is hard for a number of reasons: We are often simultaneously collecting data, and we don't want to crash the computer. This is the only Windows computer while all other computers are Linux. We have to laboriously open each image sequence as a stack and adjust thresholds depending on the channel. Multiple image stacks do not have the same thresholds, so they are not directly visually comparable. Strategy \u00b6 We will transfer the data using rsync from the Windows computer running Ubuntu WSL to our local desktop. Note that this is a temporary location. All microscope data should be transferred to the Google drive of rasi2@uw.edu directly from the microscope computer at the end of the experiment. We will run an ImageJ python script to: open all stacks of interest, channels of interest (each channel will be a separate stack). adjust the lowest and highest displayed pixel value to be the same across all stacks so that they can be compared. place the different stack windows nicely so that they are not on top of each other (works perfectly only for < 10 stacks). Preliminary Setup on microscope computer \u00b6 Open Windows Terminal as an administrator . Stop the Windows ssh service: Stop-Service sshd Open a new tab on the same Windows Terminal window but running Ubuntu . To do this, click on the down arrow at the top of the window bar.

For linear fragments, this time should be decreased to 15 minutes. Do not gel-purify the insert fragments or the backbone as much as possible.

Procedure \u00b6 Safety information \u00b6 The Plasma Cleaner is an electrical instrument: to avoid electric shock, plase observe all standard precautions, such as not operating the device near water and operating the device at appropriate libne voltage and frequency. Do not remove panels or housing, except by a certified electronics technician. Do not use the Plasma Cleaner front door when the chamber is under vacuum. Do not use the Plasma Cleaner near flammable materials. Do not plug vacuum pumps whose input electrical current requirement exceeds 7 Amps into the Plasma Cleaner rear vacuum outlet. With respect to vacuum pumps, please refer to the pump user's manual for specific precautions. If oxygen is used as the process gas in concentrations near or above its flammability thresgold, an oxygen service pump must be used. If corrosove gasses are used, make sure the seals and gas connection materials are compatible with the gas. Use a suatable vacuum pump to sercvice corrosove gases. If toxic gases or gases that ionize to toxic products or intermedeiates are usd, the gases must be properly purged from the chamber prior to venting and the pump exhaust must br properly vented. For safe gas handling prcedures specific to your process gas, contact your process gas supplier. Evacuating the chamber \u00b6 Turn on the Plasma Cleaner main power. Put the sample in the chamber: On the top of small petri-dish, I put one coverglass and one chip with the pattern side-up. Check that the 3-way valve is clesed (level is vertical, manual Figure 12C). Close and hold the front door against the chamber. Turn on the vacuum pump. The vacuum will hold the front door in place. Evacuate the chamber for 1-3 minutes or to the desired vacuum pressure. Inputing gas \u00b6 Open the 3-way vlave to air or gas (lever points to the metering valve, Figure 12A). Generating plasma \u00b6 Select the desired RF power level: Used \"low\" mode today. Look through the viewing window for the plasma glow and indication that plasma has formed . If needed, adjust the metering valve slightly until the plasma intensity is visibly maximized. This broadly corresponds to optimal plasma generation conditions. Plasma treatment \u00b6 Process the sample for the desired duration. The timing of the plasmia treatment should begin when the plasma glow is first observed. I used \\~1 minute. At the end of the process, turn off the RF power. Allow 1-3 minutes for the vacuum pump to evacuate any residual process gas from the chamber. Close the 3-way vlave (lever is vertical, Figure 12C). Venting the chamber \u00b6 Turn off the vacuum pump. Slowly open the 3-way valve to vent (lever points to vent, Figure 12B). Once atmospheric pressure is reached, close the 3-way valve (lever is vertical, Figure 12C). Turn off the Plasma Cleaner main power. Open the front ddor and remove the sample. Notes \u00b6 Here I do not use the PlasmaFlo For the protocol with the PlasmaFlo, see the manual again. Bonding chips \u00b6 Follow the short protocol without using PlasmaFlo and by only using air, I bonded one 4-channel and one 1-channel chip on the cover-glases.

Positive and Negative controls \u00b6 Always decide what positive and negative controls can tell you whether the experiment worked as expected. Include controls even if you have done an experiment several times. Skipping positive and negative controls almost never saves you time. Even if you have to repeat one experiment out of 10 because you did not have the right controls, all the time you saved is gone. Sample organization in multi-well (96-well) plates \u00b6 Decide a plate organization that makes it easy to add or remove reagents using a multichannel, and to catch systematic errors arising from a specific well location or from a specific plate. Avoid outer wells as much as possible to prevent sample evaporation. Have all samples of each biological or technical replicate together. For eg. if you have 4 knockouts, 2 reporters in each knockout, 6 replicates of each knockout-reporter combination, put the knockouts of reporter 1 in Wells B3\u2013B6, the knockouts of reporter 2 in Wells B7\u2013B10, then copy this row layout to Rows C\u2013G for the other 5 replicates. If you have too many samples to fit within one plate, split technical replicates across plates while keeping the same plate layout. It is better to have empty wells rather than having different layouts across plates. Always include positive control, negative control, media/reagent only wells in each plate. Pipetting \u00b6 When you have to add more than one reagent to several tubes, first make a master mix of all the reagents and then add the master mix to each tube. This reduces your work and also prevents variation between samples. This is especially important for enzymatic reactions. When you are making a master mix, make it for 0.5 + the number of samples. This will give you some cushion due to loss of sample sticking to pipette tip. Insert pipette tip just below the surface for enzymes and master mixes. This prevents inaccurate pipetting due to sticking to outside of pipette tips. Do not pipette volumes smaller than 0.5 \u00b5l. If necessary, first dilute your reagent to have a volume of at least 2 \u00b5l and then add it. This prevents pipetting errors. Insert pipette tips at an angle inside tubes or bottles. This prevents accidentally contamination from your pipettor. Do not insert pipettes into common lab stocks of any chemical (eg. phenol-chloroform) to avoid accidental contamination. Pour out the approximately required amount for the experiment into a 15 ml or 50 ml conical. Use the aliquot and dispose of the conical immediately. Labeling \u00b6 Keep your Eppendorf tubes in an ascending order in your tube holder and inside centrifuges. This is useful in case the label gets erased during the protocol. When you are adding reagents to a row of tubes, close the cap after you add the reagent and/or move each tube to a new row after adding the reagent. Label 15 and 50 ml conicals both on the cap and on the side. For an experiment with multiple steps, use simple numbering: 1, 2, 3 \u2026 for your 1.5 ml tubes, and have a record of what tube corresponds to what sample in your lab notebook. When you are storing any sample tubes from an experiment, label them according to our lab convention . Gibson Isothermal Assembly \u00b6 Required negative control for any Gibson reaction: A single tube containing all the DNA fragments that you used across all reactions, but without the Gibson master mix. This controls for any false positive from PCR template or undigested vector. Add all the fragments at the same concentration as what you added in your ractions. Second optional negative control: Add the vector but not the insert into the Gibson master mix. This is especially useful when your Gibson homology arms are short (<24nt) or when you are using a large parent vector (>8kb). This controls for false positive from parent vector religated back to itself. For checking your inserts by PCR or restriction digestion of minipreped vectors, use primers and restriction sites that are at least 100 bp outside the Gibson homology arms. This will indicate both no-insert as well as wrong insert false positives. While checking your inserts by PCR or restriction digestion, set up a control reactions with the parent vector. For verifying your insert by Sanger sequencing, the ideal sequencing primer should be approximately 100 bp away from your Gibson homology arm and reading towards the Gibson arm. Remember that most cloning errors tend to be in the Gibson homology region especially if you are using primers 50 nt in length. Sequencing verification \u00b6 If you have more than 2000bp to sequence verify, use PlasmidSaurus for sequencing. Sanger sequencing should be used to confirm specific mutations, not the length of a cloned insert. Do not send plasmids for Sanger sequencing before checking them by restriction digest or by PCR. Use no more than 0.1\u00b5l of restriction enzyme per digestion. While designing cloning primers, order a sequencing primer that is 100 nt upstream of the region that you want to confirm by sequencing. It is far cheaper to order a single optimally located sequencing primer than to sequence several plasmids using multiple primers. If you are sending more than 12 sequencing reactions, check with Rasi before you submit your samples.","title":"Tips for molecular biology experiments"},{"location":"experiments/organization/tips_for_molecular_biology_experiments/#positive-and-negative-controls","text":"Always decide what positive and negative controls can tell you whether the experiment worked as expected.

Think about this question in the context of experiments that you or someone else in our lab is doing. Would you have done the experiment or presented the data differently than the authors? If so, why? You should write down brief notes for the above questions besides each figure so that you do not have to re-read the caption or text during our discussion. This is easily done using Okular inline annotations in Ubuntu. I have found it useful to mark each sentence in the abstract or important sentences in the text with a different color based on the following classification (done easily using Okular annotation tools): Background Question Experiment / Analysis Result Claim / Interpretation Follow up / Useful reference The above classification helps me to quickly remember the key points of the paper during our discussion or when I come back to it several months or years later.","title":"How to read paper for journal club"},{"location":"software/","text":"Lab-Specific Software Workflows \u00b6 How to add yourself to our lab website How to draw using Inkscape Vector Graphics How to setup Zotero How to import Addgene plasmids into Snapgene How to ssh onto a remote computer without password How to connect to the Hutch network from outside How to use Rasi's laptop configuration files on your computer How to install common lab software on a new Ubuntu desktop Useful scientific software Manuals for commonly used lab software How to create Docker and Singularity images VScode \u00b6 How to customize VSCode GitHub \u00b6 How to use GitHub effectively How to write good git commit messages How to use GitHub issues and branches Visualization \u00b6 Visualization in D3 A beginner's introduction to widely used web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and D3.js. mermaid-js/mermaid: Generation of diagram and flowchart from text in a similar manner as markdown You can use it in GitHub, see here .

Adding yourself to the labwebsite involves creating a markdown page similar to this page for yourself (Click the Raw link to see the bare version). This code resulted in the final html page for Rasi on the lab website. Open a command-line terminal on your computer. Install git on your computer if you do not have it already: sudo apt install git Create a local git directory in your computer if you don't have one already by typing the following into a terminal. Note that the base directory can be slightly different in Mac and Windows machines. Adjust the commands below accordingly. It does not matter where exactly you create the git directory, but I usually create it in my home directory where I store all my repositories. mkdir /home/USER/git cd /home/USER/git Clone the labwebsite repository into your /home/USER/git directory. This will create a directory called labwebsite in your local git directory. You will have to enter your Github username and password here. git clone https://github.com/rasilab/labwebsite.git . Then copy the file git/labwebsite/members/_posts/2015-01-01-arvind-rasi-subramaniam.md to a new file in the same directory. Rename the file by replacing Rasi's name by your name and add today's date. Edit contents of the file following the same template. You can look at profiles of other lab members for reference. Create a 250\u00d7250px profile picture of yourself in gimp , inkscape or any other photo editing software. Do not have larger images as these will load slowly. Copy your picture to git/labwebsite/images/team/ folder (create a picture similar to git/labwebsite/images/team/arvind-rasi-subramaniam.jpg ). Follow the same naming convention as Rasi. Copy your CV PDF file to git/labwebsite/pdfs/team folder following the same naming convention as Rasi. Once you are satisfied with the changes, add the files you created to git repo, commit them with a message, and push them to http://github.com/rasilab/labwebsite .

All Docker images should be publicly available in our lab's GitHub container repository. For routine analyses and writing, use our lab's default R , Python , and Latex images. These images should contain commonly used libraries in our lab, as you can see in the Dockerfile of each image. If you require additional R, Python, or Latex libraries not present in the above default images, build child images based off the above base images. For example, see the MaGeCK package built off our default Python package. If you use a R, Python, or Latex library quite often and you notice that others in the lab are also using it, then incorporate it in the lab's default image while updating the repository and package tag. If you need standalone bioinformatic packages, derive them off the Miniconda3 4.12.0 base image. For example, see the Samtools package in our lab's package repository. You can also use these images as basis for other packages. For example, see the Bowtie2 package in our lab's package repository. Steps to build and tag Docker images \u00b6 To create or update a Dockerfile and the associated image , follow these steps: Edit the Dockerfile in VScode to add or remove software. Always make modifications at the end of the Dockerfile so that only few intermediate images need to be re-created. This decreases the space and time requirements for building and pushing the image. If you are creating a new GitHub repository for a new package, use a Dockerfile and README template from a previous package GitHub repository, for eg. MaGeCK . Make sure to set the repository name and description appropriately, and update its visibility to public. Build the Docker image from the folder that contains the Dockerfile . Give a specific tag (see below for tag convention). docker build -t <image_name:tag> . # example docker build -t ghcr.io/rasilab/mageck:0.5.9 . Assuming the above build command is successful, first commit and tag the Dockerfile . You might have to set the remote if you created a new GitHub repository using git remote set-url origin <url> . GitHub will prompt you for this when you create git add Dockerfile git commit -m \"Update Dockerfile with <software>\" git tag -a <tag> -m \"Update Dockerfile with <software>\" git push origin <tag> git push --all We use the same tag for the GitHub repository containing the Dockerfile and the corresponding image . Both tags follow the semantic versioning convention. In practice, this means: Use tags of the form X.Y.Z . Start with 0 for X and 1 for Y and 0 for Z . If your package is for a single software package (eg. MaGeCK), then use the same version tag as the software package version you are installing. For example, see our lab's MaGeCK image. If you fix an error in a Dockerfile/image that contains several different packages (eg. our lab's Python image), increment the third digit Z . If you add an extra package that will not break compatibility of the Docker image with previous versions, increment the second digit Y . If you make any incompatible changes, increment the first digit X (avoid this as much as possible). Push the Docker image to the GitHub container registry. The first time you do this from a computer, you will have to set up a Personal Access Token (classic version) as explained here . Make sure to give the write:packages permission when you create the token. docker push <image_name:tag> # example docker push ghcr.io/rasilab/python:1.2.0 You can pull these images as Singularity images using the following command (used on Fred Hutch cluster): module load Singularity singularity pull docker://<image_name:tag> # example singularity pull docker://ghcr.io/rasilab/python:1.0.0 If you are pulling Singularity images that are not public (avoid this as much as possible), then you need to authenticate with GitHub packages using a personal access token.

To avoid this, Rasi has stored a copy of all commonly used Singularity containers in our lab at /fh/scratch/delete90/subramaniam_a/user/rasi/singularity . You can symbolically link this folder to your workflow by executing the following from the folder that contains your Snakemake file: mkdir .snakemake cd .snakemake ln -s /fh/scratch/delete90/subramaniam_a/user/rasi/singularity .

This format is important so that we can use the same citation keys when we write. Set up BetterBibTeX to exclude certain fields, include URLs, and abbreviate journal names. Set up ZotFile to store all PDFs in your Dropbox. For eg., mine is stored at /home/rasi/Dropbox/Apps/ezPDF . This enables easy syncing between multiple computers. Set up Zotfile to rename your PDFs nicely using underscores instead spaces.

Below is a step-by-step guide to a typical experiment workflow. 1. Open a Github issue for each experiment \u00b6 Use Github Issues as the start and end points of your experiments (either wet- or dry-lab). To start an experiment, open a new issue on the respective project repository. Choose one of the issue templates (experiment, analysis, cloning, etc.) or a blank issue. Fill out the title , background and strategy sections of the issue body . background : Describe what led you to do this experiment. Your description should be understandable without reading further background. Link to issues containing previous experiments ( #<issue-number> ), analyses and external citations that will help someone who wants to dig into the details. strategy : Outline the experimental strategy in plain and understandable full sentences. Customize the tags and labels on the right panel: Assignees : who will participate in this experiment? Labels : use labels that will allow you to easily filter and manage your issues. Labels typically indicate what type of experiment it is ( analysis , idea ...) and the status of the experiment ( to do , successful ...). Projects : selecting project board automatically links the issue to your project board, which allows you to easily track all your open issues. Milestone : (optional) this allows you group issues by a common theme. Milestones might be helpful if you are at the stage where you are pursuing multiple different directions in your project. Once you have completed the information above, click Submit new issue . The next step is to set up your issue branch . 2. Create issue branch for recording your work \u00b6 The ability to have a branch for each specific issue is one of the main reasons we use GitHub as your lab notebook. Branches allow you to isolate your work on an experiment without affecting the central copy of your lab notebook, i.e the main or master branch of your project repository. This is a key feature if you are working in a collaborative experiment where each person needs to update their notes and protocols without interfering with each others work. Moreover, branches allow you to work on multiple experiments (issues) at once, while being able to keep your commit history linear for each of your experiments. The easiest way to checkout and manage your issue branches is as follows: Download the Github Issues & Pull Requests on vscode marketplace Open your project repository on vscode (make sure you are logged into GitHub) Click on the GitHub icon the extensions bar, and hover over the issue you want to start working on. Click on the arrow start working on Issue and Checkout topic branch 3. Save your progress as commits \u00b6 Now you can start working on your experiment and analyses. Remember to switch branches following the same steps whenever you want to work on different issues/branches. Record your experimental protocols in a markdown document in the experiments\\user folder. As you plan, record notes and observations, and add new files, save your progress as commits . Git/GitHub allows you save snapshots of your work as commits . Here is an example. To learn how to use version control with vscode, see here . Writing succinct but descriptive commit messages will help you find changes easily. These are some pointers on how to write good commit messages. Commits should always be linked to specific issues. You can automatically ping issue timelines with a commit by including the issue number in the issue title body. 4. Use issue comments to discuss troubleshooting and results with collaborators \u00b6 As you perform your experiment, you will often want to discuss your progress and intermediate results with your collaborators on the project. Use the comment section below the top body of the issue to post figures, links to code commits, and tables. Issue comments will capture changes in experiment design or interpretation of results. You can link to issue comments from other issues or repositories. 5. Wrap up experiment with pull requests \u00b6 Update the issue body to include the main results of your experiment or analysis.
